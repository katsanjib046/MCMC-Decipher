message: it is not easy to define this hogarthian quality in words beyond saying that it is a sort of alphabetical realism like the cruel candour of children but it has about it these two special principles which separate it from all that we call realism in our time first that with us a moral story means a story about moral people with them a moral story meant more often a story about immoral people second that with us realism is always associated with some subtle view of morals with them realism was always associated with some simple view of morals the end of bill sikes exactly in the way that the law would have killed him this is a hogarthian incident it carries on that tradition of startling and shocking platitude
